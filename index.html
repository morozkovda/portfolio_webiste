    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <p style=" margin-left:0; margin-right:0; padding-right: 15%;padding-left: 15%">Welcome to my Portfolio! Here's where I turn numbers into narratives. Think of me as a translator, taking the complex language of data and turning it into clear, actionable insights. It's like a puzzle where each piece is a stat or figure, and when put together, they reveal the bigger picture. This isn't just about charts and graphs; it's about finding the story they're trying to tell and using it to make smart, real-world decisions. Dive in, and let's explore how data can do much more than just sit on a spreadsheet!</p>

          <h3>The Art of a Dashboard</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Crafting dashboards is an art form that blends analytics with intuition, turning rows of data into visual poetry that speaks volumes about a business's performance. My first project in the project gallery encapsulates this philosophy, showcasing a fully interactive dashboard that delve into the vital signs of a business, making sense of its ups and downs, like the details in financial reports or the beat of sales and marketing. It's about turning hard-to-grasp numbers into clear visual stories that help people make smart choices and find new ways to succeed. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and try it now to gather some business insights.
        </p> <p  style="text-align: justify;"> If you're curious about what a well-crafted dashboard can do, my complete <a href="dashboards.html">portfolio</a> (click!) is the place to start. It's filled with Power BI dashboards that I've built, all focused on giving businesses a clear view to make smarter choices. Plus, there's an entertaining NBA dashboard for the sports fans out there. It's a great example of how data can be both informative and fun. Check it out to see how the right visuals can really make a difference in understanding complex information.</p>

        <h3>Machine learning</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have acquired extensive experience in Machine Learning, a crucial discipline for addressing complex challenges and making data-driven decisions. By developing a diverse range of algorithms—including k-NN for image classification, perceptron for spam email filtering, kernelized SVM for time-series prediction, and deep and convolutional neural networks for MNIST digit recognition, BERT model for downstream prediction task of Acceptability Judgements and KentaiBERT for Immanuel Kant’s speech replication — I have developed a profound understanding of various predictive and prescriptive techniques. This invaluable expertise enables me to tackle a wide array of tasks and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of Machine Learning. </p></div>

        <h3>Reinforcement learning</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">My professional area is Finance, where I employ and test different quantitative methods for improving a decision-making process.
    In the past I worked on testing two different approaches for short-term volatility forecasting on real-world data, and compiled a
    methodology for choosing a model depending on the level of market and asset variance. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">One of my latest projects in this respect involved the creation of a <a href="https://github.com/morozkovda/RL-trading-bot/tree/master">trading bot</a>. Essentially, it functions as a digital trader and leverages a sophisticated technology stack comprising Python, TensorFlow, and AWS to facilitate the buying and selling of stocks. What sets this trading bot apart is its capacity to learn and adapt autonomously. It employs an advanced technique known as Deep Q-Network (DQN) to discern the most effective actions to undertake when engaging in stock trading activities. With each trading encounter, it incrementally refines its decision-making process, assimilating lessons from both its prior missteps and successes. Over time, this continual learning process results in the bot becoming exceptionally proficient at making optimal trading decisions with the primary aim of maximizing profit.</p>

        <h3>Data Science is a Sport?</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As a data scientist, I've witnessed firsthand how our field has evolved into a competitive sport. This transformation was propelled by websites like Kaggle, which host competitions that push us to test our skills against time constraints and tough challenges. I'm particularly drawn to these competitions as they're not just about applying technical skills, but also about the thrill and pressure of performing under tight deadlines.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">One of my most memorable experiences was participating in a competition to forecast Walmart's unit sales. Our team ranked in the top 30 out of 4983, an achievement that was rewarding even though we didn't win any money prize. This competition required a complete workflow, including data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and making accurate predictions. Through this experience, I gained invaluable insights and honed my skills in Time Series Analysis and Applied Machine Learning. The techniques and approaches I used are detailed in my <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CE94KoCFxFlC3mvWipvtde8E9gM3fYg5?usp=sharing">notebook</a>, showcasing my methodology and what one can expect from my analysis. This experience solidified my expertise in areas where I excel, providing a foundation for future projects and challenges in data science.</p></div>

        <h3>Let's Rock!</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This one is for true enthusiasts and folks who are still with us. I've been playing guitar since my childhood, and it's always been a special part of my life. In a fun twist, I decided to merge this hobby with my data science skills. Using the Reverb API, I took a deep dive into the guitar market. My project was focused on uncovering trends in guitar prices, especially in the used gear market. It was fascinating to see how the data unfolded, revealing patterns and insights about guitar pricing that aren't immediately obvious. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The outcome of this project (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NhXFp_MYIbY0wGYekUxQVj8qdN_ppOQE?usp=sharing">link</a>) was not only informative but also practical. I compiled all the insights and advice into a Google Colab notebook, showcasing my approach to data analysis and exploratory data analytics. This project, while a bit different from my usual work, was a great way to combine my personal interest with my professional skills. It's a perfect example for anyone interested in how data science can be applied in everyday hobbies and interests. If you're curious about guitars or data, you might find this analysis both useful and enjoyable.</p>

My professional experience in this field has only deepened my appreciation for its potential. It's not just about the technical aspects, but also how it empowers users with more control and security over their data. The sense of community and innovation in the Web3 space is incredible, and it's exciting to be part of something that's reshaping how we interact with the digital world."</p>
